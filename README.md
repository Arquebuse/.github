# Arquebuse project

Arquebuse is an open-source notification system tailored specifically for enterprise environments, providing secure and efficient delivery of targeted notifications to Windows desktop users.

Designed with simplicity at its core, Arquebuse integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure, allowing administrators to easily select recipients, send critical application outage alerts, and request user acknowledgments directly via the native Windows notification center. 

It respects users' "Do Not Disturb" settings, ensuring alerts are delivered respectfully without disruption. Arquebuse simplifies enterprise communication, empowering organizations to effectively manage notifications at scale.
